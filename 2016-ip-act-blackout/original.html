We take 2 things seriously (and lots of things jokingly):<br />
<br />
1) Our users having a positive experience with our site<br />
</br>
And certainly the most important,<br />
<br />
3) The safety and privacy of everyone, be they a visitor of our site, a citizen of our country, or anyone else on the internet.<br />
<br />
Privacy is not and never will be a joke.<br />
<br />
It is not funny.<br />
<br />
It is not a plaything for politicians.<br />
<br />
It cannot be removed from a populous without <a class="link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3208907/The-Ashley-Madison-suicide-Texas-police-chief-takes-life-just-days-email-leaked-cheating-website-hack.html" target="blank_"> risking actual life</a>, as history has proven<br /> again</a>, and again, and again, regardless of who is removing it.<br />
<br />
As such, we cannot stand idly by and watch the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigatory_Powers_Act_2016" target="blank_"> Investigatory Powers Bill </a> go unchallenged.<br />
<br />
The provisions of the Investigatory Powers Act are as follows:<br />
<br />
It requires ISPs to retain UK internet users' ICRs – which websites were visited but not the particular pages on the website for an entire year after you visited each and every one.<br />
<br />
It permits the police and intelligence agencies to carry out “targeted equipment interference”. In other words, hacking into computers or devices and bulk equipment interference, meaning they can see anything and everything you have stored on your computer, and probably a hell of a lot more that you don’t, because most people are constantly connected to a cloud storage service.<br />
<br />
It mandates that ISPs in the UK must have the ability to remove <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" target="blank_"> encryption </a> applied by the ISP; foreign companies are not required to remove encryption.<br />
<br />
This would mean that not only could we not protect your connection to our site by default, but that if our site is ever deemed “suspicious” (for whatever reason or whim it may be) your device could be hacked by your own government under the guise of “counter-terrorism”.<br />
<br />
